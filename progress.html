        <h2>Bake Sale</h2>
        <p>
          Huge congratulations to our team of Sixth Form students for their
          outstanding success in the recent bake sale! The team's hard work and
          dedication truly paid off as they were able to raise an impressive
          £274.32 for their cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to extend our gratitude to all the generous students who
          went above and beyond to bake or purchase delicious treats, as well as
          to all those who supported the sale by purchasing them. Without their
          contributions, this success would not have been possible. Thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The treats and cakes were in high demand and the entire school
          community came together to support the team's efforts. These funds
          will go a long way in reaching our goal of raising £1500 to support
          the cost of a new ID scanner for the school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team should be incredibly proud of their achievement. Not only did
          they raise much-needed funds for the school, but they also
          demonstrated their leadership, teamwork, and organisational skills.
          They have set a shining example for their peers and the younger
          students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once again, congratulations to the team on their outstanding bake sale
          success. Keep up the fantastic work!
