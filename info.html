        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to our about page! I, the author, creator and founder of this
          website and I am excited to share it with you. I am a year 12 computer science student at the Willink School
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea for this website came to me when I realized there was a need
          for a platform that could provide information on our fundraising
          campaign. I wanted to create a place where people could come and
          easily find the information they needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed the layout and functionality of the website with the user
          experience in mind. I wanted to make it as user-friendly and easy to
          navigate as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website was then built using the latest web development
          technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also integrated
          various features to enhance the user experience such as a responsive
          design, search function, and social media integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the website grows, I will continue to add new features and improve
          the overall user experience. I welcome any feedback or suggestions you
          may have to help improve the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you find the information on this website helpful and
          informative. Thank you for visiting!
