        <h2>Introduction to Us and Our Goals</h2>
        <p>
          We are a group of Year 12 students at The Willink School working to
          raise Â£3000 towards the recently-bought ID scanner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to implement a new ID scanner to improve the efficient
          entry and exit of students and staff. In turn, this will reduce congestion in
          the school halls and the time spent walking to and from Tesco.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          We have plans set in motion to progress towards our goal, but we still
          need your help to complete it. Every penny counts and by donating, you
          will have helped our village school, keep a global outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make a donation by contacting either Jake Evans or Isaac
          Kennington (Year 12 students). Our details can be accessed via the contact button at the top of
          this page. Please share this campaign with friends, family, and others
          to help us spread the word and complete our goal.
