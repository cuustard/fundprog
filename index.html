        <h2>Introduction to Us and Our Goals</h2>
        <p>
          We are a group of Year 12 students at The Willink School working to
          raise £1500 towards the recently-bought ID scanner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to implement a new ID scanner to ammend more accessible
          entry and exit of students and staff. In turn, this will reduce
          congestion in the school halls.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          We have plans set in motion to progress towards our goal, but we still
          need your help to complete it. Every penny counts and by donating, you
          will have helped our village school, keep a global outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make a donation by contacting us via the contact button at the
          top of this page. Please share this campaign with friends, family, and
          others to help us spread the word and complete our goal.
